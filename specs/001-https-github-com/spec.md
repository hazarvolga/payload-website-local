## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a **developer**, I want to clone the Payload CMS website repository, install its dependencies, and run it locally so that I can develop or test the website in a local environment.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Repository Cloning**  
   - Given the repository URL, When I clone the repository, Then the source code is downloaded successfully.  
2. **Dependencies Installed**  
   - Given the project is cloned, When I install dependencies, Then all required packages are installed without errors.  
3. **Run Development Server**  
   - Given dependencies are installed, When I start the server, Then the Payload website is accessible at a local URL (e.g., http://localhost).  
4. **Error Handling**  
   - Given a failure occurs (e.g., invalid URL, missing dependency, port conflict), Then a clear error message is displayed to guide resolution.  

### Edge Cases
- Repository URL is invalid or inaccessible  
- Node.js / npm not installed on system  
- Network issues during dependency installation  
- Default port already in use when starting the server

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST clone the repository from the provided GitHub URL.  
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate the local environment has Node.js and package manager installed.

- **FR-004**: System MUST run the development server and expose a local URL.  
- **FR-005**: System MUST display meaningful error messages if any step fails.  
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow re-running installation or server start without requiring manual cleanup.  

### Key Entities
