# Research Findings

## Technical Decisions

- **Decision**: Use Node.js 18+ as the runtime environment.
  - **Rationale**: Payload CMS officially requires Node.js 18 or higher for compatibility and security.
  - **Alternatives considered**: Node.js 16, but deprecated; Node.js 20 for latest features, but 18 is stable.

- **Decision**: Use Payload CMS as the primary headless CMS framework.
  - **Rationale**: Explicitly mentioned in the feature description as the target system.
  - **Alternatives considered**: Strapi, Directus, or Contentful, but Payload is specified.

- **Decision**: Use npm for package management and script execution.
  - **Rationale**: Standard tool for Node.js projects, widely supported.
  - **Alternatives considered**: Yarn or pnpm, but npm is default and sufficient.

- **Decision**: Use Git for repository cloning.
  - **Rationale**: The repository is hosted on GitHub, Git is the standard tool.
  - **Alternatives considered**: None, as it's the only option for GitHub repos.

- **Decision**: No specific performance goals defined for local development setup.
  - **Rationale**: The feature focuses on setup and running locally, not performance optimization.
  - **Alternatives considered**: Define startup time <5s, but not critical for this scope.

- **Decision**: Use MongoDB or PostgreSQL for storage (as configured in Payload).
  - **Rationale**: Payload CMS supports both, depending on project configuration.
  - **Alternatives considered**: SQLite for simplicity, but Payload prefers the above.

- **Decision**: Use Jest for unit testing and Cypress for end-to-end testing.
  - **Rationale**: Common choices for Node.js and web projects.
  - **Alternatives considered**: Mocha for unit, Playwright for e2e, but Jest/Cypress are standard.

## Resolved Unknowns
- Performance Goals: Not applicable for local setup feature.
- Constraints: Limited to local development environment.
- Scale/Scope: Single developer usage.</content>
